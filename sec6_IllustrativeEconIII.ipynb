    "# 6 Illustrative economy III: carbon abatement technology\n",
    "\n",
    "While the model posed in section [4](sec4_IllustrativeEconI.ipynb) illustrated how the unfolding of damages should alter policy, the economic model was not designed to confront transitions to fully carbon-neutral economies.  There have been several calls for such transitions with little regard for the role or impact of uncertainty.  We now modify the model to allow for green technology in decades to come.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We next consider a technology that is close to the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model  of \\cite{Nordhaus:2017}. See also \\cite{CaiJuddLontzek:2017} and \\cite{CaiLontzek:2019} for a stochastic extension (DSICE)  of the DICE model.\\footnote{Among other stochastic components, the DSICE incorporates tipping elements and characterizes the SCC as a stochastic process. From a decision theory perspective, DSICE focuses on risk aversion and intertemporal substitution under an assumption of rational expectations.}  For our setting, we alter the output equation from our previous specification as follows:\n",
