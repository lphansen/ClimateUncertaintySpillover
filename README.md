# Climate Change Uncertainty Spillover in the Macroeconomy
This repository contains codes and jupyter notebooks which compute and demonstrate results of "Climate Change Uncertainty Spillover in the Macroeconomy" by [Micheal Barnett][id1], [William Brock][id2] and [Lars Peter Hansen][id3]. Latest version could be found [here][id4].

For further detail of computation, see also: [online documentation](https://climateuncertaintyspillover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## <a name="prerequisite"></a>Prerequisite
`Python == 3.8.x`, package manager such as `pip`,  and `jupyter notebook` to checkout the notebooks.

To go to the documentation of this project, please go to: (link avaliable when published).

This project has been tested in an environment with
> `Python == 3.8.7` and  `jupyter notebook == 5.7.10`

To store the notebook as well as codes in your local machine. You can do this by following steps below:

1.  Open a Windows command prompt, Mac terminal or Linux terminal and change into the folder you would like to store the files.
 	-  You can do this using the command `cd` in the command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on Mac and Linux).
        - For example, running `cd 'C:\Users\username\python'` (don’t forget '' around the path name to use an absolute path) would lead me to my designated folder.

    ```bash
    $ cd [folder path name]
    ```

2.  Clone the github repository for the paper
    - If you don’t have github installed, try installing it from this page: https://git-scm.com/download.
    - You can do this by running below in the command prompt:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/lphansen/WrestlingClimatie.git
    ```

3.  Change directories into the ‘Wrestling’ folder and install the required packages for the current user or your initiated virtual environment:

    ```bash
    $ cd WrestlingClimate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Access the notebooks, run the following under the folder `WrestlingClimate/`:

    ```bash
    $ jupyter notebook
    ```
    and you will see the notebooks listed below.

    Then click <button type = "button" name="runall">Run all</button> from <button type="runtime" name="runtime">runtime</button> to see our results.
