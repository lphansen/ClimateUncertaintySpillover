To store the notebook as well as codes in your local machine. You can do this by following steps below:

1.  Open a Windows command prompt, Mac terminal or Linux terminal and change into the folder you would like to store the files.
 	-  You can do this using the command `cd` in the command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on Mac and Linux).
        - For example, running `cd 'C:\Users\username\python'` (don’t forget '' around the path name to use an absolute path) would lead me to my designated folder.
     
    ```bash
    cd [folder path name]
    ```

2.  Clone the github repository for the paper
    - If you don’t have github installed, try installing it from this page: https://git-scm.com/download.
    - You can do this by running below in the command prompt:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lphansen/ClimateUncertaintySpillover.git
    ```
    
3.  Change directories into the ‘Wrestling’ folder and install the required packages for the current user or your initiated virtual environment:
    
    ```bash
    cd ClimateUncertaintySpillover
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Download the large data files from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vjr8PrlmX4ABRN2S6L0aCDf6omQJHA1R):
```
gdown -O ./data/ --folder 1vjr8PrlmX4ABRN2S6L0aCDf6omQJHA1R
```

5. Access the notebooks, run the following under the folder `ClimateUncertaintySpillover/`:
    
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    and you will see the notebooks listed below.
